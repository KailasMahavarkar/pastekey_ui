1. Your password is hashed using the SHA-512 algorithm.
2. A random number, called the "view seed" (VSEED), is generated by the browser.
3. The VSEED is encrypted using the AES-256 algorithm with hashed password as key for encryption.
4. The encrypted VCT is used to verify your identity and grant access to your paste.
**The server has no information about your password; it only has [rand, VCT], which it will store in the database.**

This approach has two advantages:

-   No one can access your paste without knowing your password not even our server.
-   Even if someone has access to database, he/she can't decrypt your paste without knowing your password.

> We recommend that you use a strong password because we do not store it in plain text and cannot recover it for you.

#### Potential benefits of this approach

1. When you want to read a private paste, you will receive a challenge in the form of a VCT.
2. If you know the correct password, you can use it to decrypt the VCT and get the rand.
3. To retrieve the paste, you must send a request with the rand to the server.
4. The server will check if the rand in your request matches the one stored in the database.
5. If the rand matches, the server will send you the paste.
6. You can decrypt the paste using your password and view it.

## Data handling

### scenario (you create private paste)
1. You create a new paste with two tabs: "Hello" and "World".
2. You decide to make this paste private.
3. To keep the content of the paste secure, we use the AES-256 algorithm to encrypt the tabs using your password hash.
4. The encrypted paste is then saved to the database.
> We don't know content of your paste, if you find any paste which is legally questionable and open, please report it to us.
